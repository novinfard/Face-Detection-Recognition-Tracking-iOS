# Face Detection, Recognition and Tracking with Machine Learning and Vision in iOS

In this iOS application, we can detect a face, recognise whose face is this and then track it via video or real-time camera in 3 separate phases.

I demonestrate how this process is feasible by using in-device ML and vision facilities such as CoreML and Vision framework, and how we can can make some part of this process server-side, considering critical view including advantages and disadvantages for each of them.
